    When it rains the water 
    <br />raises the dead 
    <br />street long enough 
    <br />to let the wheels
    <br />find the divots of neglect.
    <br />That is why I walked
    <br />barefoot to your lintel:
    <br />everything built skews
    <br />away from us and toward
    <br />the gray light of wealth.
    <br />Whether it is cold
    <br />or the stucco hot,
    <br />I will remind you to be afraid.
    <br />I am trying to tell you
    <br />neither the road nor the river
    <br />can carry the house.
